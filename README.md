# OS-Scheduler-Sim
This project is a Java-based GUI simulator for various CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJN, RR, etc. It helps users visualize, test, and compare the performance of these algorithms based on different CPU scheduling criteria like waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

üîç Key Highlights:
GUI-based Interface: User-friendly and interactive.

Supports Multiple Algorithms: Includes FCFS, RR, SJN, and more.

Custom Inputs: Users can enter process details (burst time, priority, arrival time).

Performance Metrics: Displays execution order, waiting time, turnaround time, etc.

üõ† Structure & Usage:
Source code is under src/main/.

Uses JDK 8+ and optionally Apache Maven.

Run via IDE or terminal to simulate and visualize CPU scheduling.
